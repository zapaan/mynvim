Note to my future self (and anybody else that somehow ended up here):  
You're the laziest bastard ever born on this planet, so this install script contains no complex wizardry, though it should still run correctly from anywhere, anytime (on a standard linux).

Find neovim config directory and install everything in there.

###### Installation
requires (on path):
- neovim 0.4.4
- git
- python 3 (probably 3.6+)
- wget

`bash <(wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zapaan/mynvim/0.4.4-python/clean_install.sh -qO -)`
